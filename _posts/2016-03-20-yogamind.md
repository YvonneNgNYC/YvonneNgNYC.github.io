## Yoga Mind, Body & Spirit

This book introduce Yoga from three part. Part I is groundwork, which introduce the Yogis philosophy and ethics.
Part II is about different postures and Part III is about how to practice.

What is yoga, it is a means of staying in intimate communication with the formative core matrix of yourself and those forces that serve to bind all living beings together. As we establish and sustain this intimate connection, this state of equanimity becomes the core of our experience rather than the rare exception.

In the same way, yoga is not about self-improvement or making ourselves better. It is a process of deconstructing all the barriers we may have erected that prevent us from having an authentic connection with ourselves and with the world. This tenet is an extremely important one because the effort to change and improve ourselves is fraught with the risk of subtle self-aggression that only produces more unhappiness. We cannot strive toward something that we already are.

Patanjali, the author of the Yoga Sutras, clearly defines an eight-limbed path ( ashtanga ) that forms the structural framework for whatever emphasis upon which an individual wishes to concentrate.
Yamas and Niyamas: Ten ethical precepts that allow us to be at peace with ourselves, our family, and our community.
Asanas: Dynamic internal dances in the form of postures. These help to keep the body strong, flexible, and relaxed. Their practice strengthens the nervous system and refines our process of inner perception.
Pranayama: Roughly defined as breathing practices, and more specifically defined as practices that help us to develop constancy in the movement of prana, or life force. Pratyahara: The drawing of one’s attention toward silence rather than toward things.
Dharana: Focusing attention and cultivating inner perceptual awareness.
Dhyana: Sustaining awareness under all conditions.
Samadhi: The return of the mind into original silence.


Yamas talked about Wise Characteristics

Ahimsa—Compassion for All Living Things

Satya—Commitment to the Truth

One of the best ways we can develop this capacity is to practice right speech. This means that when we say something, we are sure of its truth.

Asteya—Not Stealing
