##Prasarita Padottanasana, Intense Spread leg stretch. 

If you have high blood pressure or severe back problem, anytime you feel uncomfortable, ease yourself into a child pose.
Start with a standing position. Take a deep breath and jump to spread you feet apart.
Make sure the outer ridges of your feet are parallel to the yoga mat.
Put you hand on your hips.
Press deeply down on the ground through the four corners of the feet. Lift your quadriceps and lift your inner thighs. 
Feel you are spinning your inner thighs back and back, spinning your outer thighs evenly back. Firm your outer hips. 
One deep breath in. When breathing out, lengthen your upper body and start getting your chest down, then parallel to the floor,
Make sure the ball of your feet an heals down. And feel the energy coming from the arch or your feet to you thighs. Keep your neck long and looking forward. 
We are going to place the palms on the mat. if you can put them between your feet and bring your elbows towards your body and gently put your head on the mat. Your feet, hands and head are on the same line. Otherwise, you can try to put the palms in front of the mat, make sure your upper body is lengthened. And put your head on the ground, bend your elbows like doing a chataranka. Then moving your palms back and back toward the line of your feet.
Take two deep breaths here. This pose helps our body to calm the brain, lower blood pressure and stretch your hamstrings and adductor muscles.
On the breath out, press your palms firmly on the ground and raise your head up. Raise your hands up and put them on your waist. You can do it one side first then the other side, if you feel dizzy or have balancing problems here.
Keep your neck long and slowly come up to a standing position. 
Exhale. Jump or walk to get your legs together.
