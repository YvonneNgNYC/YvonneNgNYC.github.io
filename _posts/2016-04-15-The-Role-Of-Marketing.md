Truly effective marketing is not even about how great you think your product is – it is about what it can do to change or enhance your consumers’ lives – Seth Godin
 
Strong Brand, relevant and beneficial differentiated products ->

The rise of discounter airlines with ultra low fares has commoditized the air travel insustry but Swill airt decided to respond differently.
Goal is to build a strong differentiated brand that could justify the high prices.

Make sure we understand what consumers need and value
Develop a brand and products that deliver value to our consumers

Consumer and brands are at the heart of marketing
 
Consumers are getting more powerful, consumer understanding is at the heart of marketing-led success
The more we understand the consumer the stronger brands we can build. Great marketing organizations build brands that deliver their promise
Great marketing organizations deliver fresh and innovative ways of engaging with consumers.

Effective campaign
Our promise to customers should be clear fair transparent and accurate. Uphold promises by ensuring that our customers have an overall positive experience that they receive clear and consistent communications and we fulfil our offers properly 100% of the time and that exceptional customer service is provided in relation to those offers.
Errors in campaigns lead to damage to the brand and reputation as well as potential financial impacts
